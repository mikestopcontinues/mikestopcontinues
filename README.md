### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mike Stop Continues, a principal software engineer and entrepreneur with a passion for combining technical expertise, product design, and innovative thinking to make the internet increasingly awesome. Iâ€™ve directed many teams, leading engineering, product development, and project management, with engineering contributions in frontend, backend, machine learning, and devops. In my 15+ years of engineering, I've also bootstrapped several startups (most recently, [SiteArcade](https://www.sitearcade.com)).

I'm currently building [BrowserCat](https://www.browsercat.com), a service providing APIs for easy headless browser automation, with dedicated solutions for web scraping, automated testing, image generation, and monitoring. The project catering to SMBs and engineering teams interested in using browser automation to save time, money, and headspace.
