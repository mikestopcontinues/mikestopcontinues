### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mike Stop Continues, a principal software engineer and entrepreneur with a passion for combining technical expertise, product design, and innovative thinking to make the internet increasingly awesome. Iâ€™ve directed many teams, leading engineering, product development, and project management, with engineering contributions in frontend, backend, machine learning, and devops.  I've also bootstrapped several startups (most recently, [SiteArcade](https://www.sitearcade.com)).

I'm currently building [BrowserCat](https://www.browsercat.com), a service providing APIs for easy headless browser automation, with dedicated solutions for web scraping, automated testing, image generation, and monitoring. The project catering to SMBs and engineering teams interested in using browser automation to save time, money, and headspace.

I also offer services as a fractional CTO. I love working with startups on a wide range of problems, including leveling up junior dev teams, developing stable and expandable software systems, driving user research and product roadmaps, as well as managing projects and timelines. I aim for excellence, efficiency, and long-term sustainability.

Reach out to discuss my fractional CTO services or chat about recent developments in software, technology, and entrepreneurship.
